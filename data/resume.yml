      **Howdy**. I am a *junior developer* based in Portland, Oregon. Are you building an awe-inspiring web app? Maybe I could help. I want to be a part of a team of hard-working talented developers who are excited about their projects, who value mentorship, who push their limits, who refactor, who write test-coverage, and who value agile.  I want to **grow** a lot as a developer over the next few years, and I am looking for an employer that can provide me with opportunities to do that.  I've been coding since middle school, I bring maturity, leadership, and a plenitude of experience in multiple languages, frameworks, and libraries.  If you are seeking someone to bring the **awesome-sauce**, we need to talk.
